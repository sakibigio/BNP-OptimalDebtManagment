# BNP-OptimalDebtManagment
Excel Spreadsheet to Implement Optimal Debt Management Analysis in Excel


This repository provides excel sheets and a readmen file to produce an implementation in Microsoft Excel of the debt-maturity optimization model in
Bigio, Nuno, and Passadore (2022), forthcoming at the Journal of Political Economy: Macroeconomics. The
paper characterizes the optimal debt-maturity management problem of a government that issues a continuum
of finite-maturity bonds in the presence of liquidity costs.

This repository is created to facilitate debt management offices with a simple model to plan and evaluate their debt management practices.

The Excel File 

The Excel file is organized in five sheets. 

In Parameters, the user inputs the parameters of the model, as
well as the initial distribution of debt and the exogenous paths of output and the international risk-free
interest rate. 

The sheet Steady State computes the steady state values of the main variables and Dynamics
computes the transitional dynamics of the model. The sheet Run contains a button to run the algorithm
that finds the optimal maturity structure. Finally, the sheet Graphs contains some plots to visually analyze
the transitional dynamics.
